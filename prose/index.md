I swear I'll write about something other than A/B Street eventually. Some essays:

- [The Almost Postmortem](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/history/retrospective/index.html)
- [Theory of change](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/software/ungap_the_map/motivation.html)

Technical articles, with lots of pictures and the appropraite amount of humor:

- [Deep dive into devilish details: Intersection geometry](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/tech/map/geometry/index.html)
- [Discrete event traffic simulation, laggy heads, and ghosts](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/tech/trafficsim/discrete_event/index.html)

I took a long trip in December 2023 and wrote about it:

- [Part 1: Hong Kong](dec2023/pt1_hk.md)
- [Part 2: Tokyo](dec2023/pt2_tokyo.md)
- [Part 3: Takayama](dec2023/pt3_takayama.md)
