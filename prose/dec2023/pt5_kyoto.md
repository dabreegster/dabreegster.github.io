## Introduction: Kyoto (2 days)

Like Tokyo, I think I enjoyed this visit to Kyoto more than 2019.

### Being a tourist

### Cars

I have to check my notes from 2019, but the famous [Kiyamachi Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyamachi_Street) was... a rat-run for cars. If you walk along the water, you dodge southbound traffic.

### The ridge of leaves

After coffee and pancakes on the Philosopher's Path, I made my way up Mt Daimonji. After getting to the top, there was something translated as "spider valley" on the map that I was curious about, so I found a path sliding down a leafy hill and stumbled into the real charm of this area.

My new route went along a ridge slippery with leaves. There were sections where once again I felt like I was swimming through them. I know this is not exactly where Miyamoto grew up and got inspiration for Zelda, but that didn't stop me from humming the Lost Woods theme or returning to a dusty old idea for a game (set in a sort of bijection space between a city and a forest). If I had a place like this so readily accessible, I would heal my knee injuries through conditioning by just natural movement. I _need_ a place like this for my sanity, or inner child, or something.

### The river

Without really trying to, I found two of my old parkour spots from 2019. There must be inherent network structure or a pattern to my wandering. It was bittersweet to find these and remember how much fun I had last time. But now I have the ridge of leaves, and anyway, I'll find a way to return to jumping/striding someday.

The place where the Kamo River and Takano River meets has some significance in the [Night is Short, Walk on Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Is_Short,_Walk_On_Girl) and/or [Tatami Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy), and I can see why. Slowly walking here at dusk, I experienced my second moment of deep inner stillness.

### Fushimi Inari

I paid another visit to this famous shrine. I didn't really get much out of it in 2019, but this time I did. It's a delightful experience of light vs shadow and reptition vs variation. The narrow spaces have a very solemn tone.

Someone asked me how long an optional loop took, and expressed concern that they heard the lights would go off at 8. I thought that was funny -- there's no way they would strand a bunch of tourists in the dark, right? Nearly at the bottom, I stopped to wait with somebody who had rolled their ankle going down the dark steps. I was able to offer tape, but they denied further help. I really hope the rest of their night and trip was alright. Visiting a new place without being able to walk comfortably can be a bit miserable.

## Narita (a day)

I had about a half-day in Narita before an early flight to Seoul. I thought it'd just be a transition day and didn't expect to write about it, but actually... I went for an evening walk along the main shopping street, but there were was too much traffic passing quickly on the narrow street, so I wandered off to a temple and pagoda and found more peaceful nocturnal moments of delight.

It was kind of surreal to emerge from that and find myself in some parody of American suburbia, complete with a stroad and excessive parking.

I waded through the parking lot into a mall with the hugest grocery store I've seen in Japan, at that perfect time of night when all the deli items get massively discounted.

## What's next

Onto Seoul, my last stop!
