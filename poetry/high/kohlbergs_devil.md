# Kohlberg's Devil

Blush: avoid those eyes, that charred grin
Let ice be unbroken, an archaic dream the tragic fiction.
Yet parasites and succubi line this lusty sin
Addiction now, by now pursue with objective depiction

Brownie points, to trade between tongues
Earning piety with the shadow measuring beneath
Your stride. Keep five feet away, sensuous lungs
From a sweaty palm, the red smile, with teeth...

Better rationalize the glue binding your body's needs
and a mind, orbiting closer. Squeeze your fingers
between mine when it hurts. Ground your floating creed
onto this constellation, where disposition lingers

Has this pseudo-soulmate kept up with your progression?
Try to quit. Confess the expression, or repress the regression.
