I've been writing since childhood, off and on. In high school, a certain teacher introduced me to the work of Charles Simic, and for a while, I practiced imitation. Through that, I think I found my voice.

> Monotonic toxic release
> Shepard tones, chilling bones
> Forever up a stair increase

## Junior high

Not very much of my early work is worth sharing, but [replay value](jr_high/replay_value.md) is representative of the pre-Simic era.

## High school

A series of villanelles, originally published in my school's paper, "The Wolf Howls":

- [A Heart's Proprietary Design](high/hearts_proprietary_design.md)
- [black humor](high/black_humor.md)
- [The Great Heist](high/great_heist.md)
- [The False Villanelle](high/false_villanelle.md) -- this was meant to end the series, but I hadn't found closure yet.
- [unfinished business](high/unfinished_business.md)

I've only ever written [one haiku](high/haiku.md).

I occasionally tried sonnet-like constraints, like [Kohlberg's Devil](high/kohlbergs_devil.md).

And others:

- [Hotel Solipcyst](high/hotel_solipcyst.md) -- eventually this became a game
- [Night Photography](high/night_photography.md)
- [On Friendship Ending (remixed)](high/on_friendship_ending.md)
- [a ritualistic season(ing)](high/ritualistic_seasoning.md) -- trying to capture that Louisiana background
- [before the wavefunction collapses](high/wave_function_collapse.md)
- [kinematic hedonism](high/kinematic_hedonism.md)
- [Tree](high/tree.md)

## College

A few of these were written for a [very specific audience](https://cns.utexas.edu/honors/honors-programs-center/deans-scholars):

- [Abstractions, love, and other general nonsense](college/abstractions.md)
- [Overheard by somebody sleeping in the GDC](college/overheard_gdc.md)

And some others:

- [discrete event simulation.](college/discrete_event_simulation.md) -- The more I understood, the more it bothered me
- [thought-trains and loco locomotives](college/loco_locomotive.md)
- [red kites and devils' advocates](college/red_kites.md)

## Later

Writing almost feels like a lost muscle now, but sometimes it still has to happen.

[Hermetically sealed soup](adult/hermetically_sealed_soup.md) is an attempt at finding second wind in an airlock.

I wrote [First contact](adult/first_contact.md) for [Once is never](https://www.instagram.com/onceisnever_parkourzine/), a parkour zine produced by my good friends. Between when I first drafted it and finally finished it, lots happened in the world, and I realized I had inadvertently written about at least 3 totally separate things.

First sonnet in at least a decade involves [public transit](adult/public_transit.md).
